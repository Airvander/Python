1.   Get the last digit of the binary value, call this digit the currentDigit.  

2.   Make a variable, say, n.  Set the value to 0.

3.   Multiply currentDigit with 2 to the power of n, store the result.

4.   Increment n by 1.

5.   Set the currentDigit to the previous digit of the binary value.

6.   Repeat from step 3 until all digits are done.

7.   Sum all the result obtained in step 3, this gives you the decimal equivalent.
